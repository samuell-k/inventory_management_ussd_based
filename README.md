Project Name: USSD Inventory Management Application
Project Overview
This USSD-based application is a lightweight inventory management system that allows an admin to manage stock using a mobile phone no internet required. It is ideal for basic product tracking through a simple menu-driven interface.
Purpose
The goal of this project is to allow an administrator to:
â€¢	Register into the system
â€¢	Access the main menu after registration
â€¢	Add new products to the system
â€¢	Record stock coming in (Product In) by entering product Name, entering quantity, and price
â€¢	Record stock going out (Product Out) by entering product name, entering quantity and price. 
â€¢	View all stored products, product in and product out with their details
Key Features
1.	Admin Registration
o	The admin must register before accessing any other features.
o	Upon successful registration, an SMS is sent to confirm that the registration was successful.
2.	Main Menu Options
Once registered, the admin can access the following:
o	Add Product: Add a new product name to the system.
o	Product In: Enter product name, and then enter quantity.
o	Product Out: Enter product name and record outgoing quantity.
o	View Products: Display all added products with their Updated Quantity.

3.	Add Product
o	Admin inputs the product name only.
o	The product is saved and becomes available for selection during Product In and Product Out operations.
4.	Product In
o	Admin must Enter Product Name
o	Admin then inputs:
ï‚§	Quantity of stock received
o	The system records the stock-in operation.
5.	Product Out
o	Admin must Enter Product Name and provides quantity being taken out of stock.
o	This helps maintain an accurate inventory.
6.	View Products
o	Displays all product names along with stock quantities.
 Technologies Used
â€¢	Backend: PHP
â€¢	Database: MySQL
â€¢	Platform: XAMPP (Local Server)
â€¢	Interface: USSD logic via PHP (index.php and menu.php)
How It Works
1.	User dials a USSD code (e.g., *123#).
2.	index.php processes the request.
3.	menu.php navigates the user through menu options.
4.	The admin selects an action:
o	Add Product â†’ Inputs name only.
o	Product In â†’ Enter Product Name â†’ Enter quantity.
o	Product Out â†’Enter Product Name â†’ Enter quantity.
o	View Products â†’ Views list of all products.
5.	Each action interacts with the database and returns a simple text response.
